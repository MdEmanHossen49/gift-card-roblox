## Are Free Unused Roblox Gift Card Codes Real?

Unfortunately, most claims of free unused Roblox gift card codes are not genuine. Hereâ€™s why:

Roblox gift card codes are distributed through authorized retailers and the Roblox website. They are not randomly generated and cannot be hacked or guessed.

- Waste your time with endless tasks and surveys.

### 3. **No Legitimate Source Offers Free Codes**
If a source claims to provide free and unused gift card codes without requiring legitimate effort (e.g., purchasing or earning them), itâ€™s a red flag. Always verify the authenticity of the source.

## How to Spot Scams

### Red Flags to Watch Out For:
- **Websites Claiming Unlimited Codes**: These sites cannot generate valid codes.
- **Surveys and Downloads**: Many fake sites require you to complete surveys or download apps that do not lead to actual codes.
- **Requests for Account Details**: Never share your Roblox login credentials, as this could lead to account theft.
- **No Verified Reviews**: Check online reviews or forums. If a site or tool is a scam, others will likely have flagged it.
